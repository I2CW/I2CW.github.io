    <h2><a id="mozTocId711180" class="mozTocH2"></a>BTC Core Abilities Assessed
      in This Course</h2>
    <p> The faculty of Blackhawk Technical College has identified seven related
      topics of soft skills, or “core abilities” that are crucial to success
      both during school and after graduation. These essential skills are taught
      across programs and departments so that each Blackhawk Technical College
      student can expect to work toward improving and applying these critical
      soft skills and core abilities regardless of their program of choice.
      Though students can expect to be assessed on all seven core abilities by
      the end of their programs, a smaller number is assessed in each class.</p>
    <p> <b>BTC Core Abilities</b></p>
    <p> <b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communicate Professionally</b></p>
    <p><b> 2.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use Appropriate Technology</b></p>
    <p><b> 3.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work Effectively in Teams</b></p>
    <p><b> 4.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demonstrate Professional Work Behavior</b></p>
    <p><b> 5.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Show Respect for Diversity</b></p>
    <p><b> 6.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solve Problems Efficiently</b></p>
    <p><b> 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lead by Example</b></p>
    <b> </b><br>
    <p> At the end of the semester after you take the final exam, students will
      receive a final grade on their professional work behavior based on a ten
      point scale.&nbsp; The following five items make up your score.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <ol>
      <li> <b>Communicate professionally</b></li>
      <ol>
        <li> Emails, phone messages, speaking in class are formal and
          appropriate to a professional work environment.|</li>
      </ol>
      <li> <b>Use appropriate technology </b></li>
      <ol>
        <li>You do not use technology as an excuse for not getting your work in
          on time or not at all.&nbsp; </li>
      </ol>
      <li> <b>Show respect for diversity.</b></li>
      <ol>
        <li> Treat others as you would want to be treated.</li>

      </ol>
      <li> <b>Demonstrate punctuality</b></li>

        <li> Turn assignments and assessments in on time.</li>

    <p> Course start and end dates:&nbsp; _____________________ to
      ___________________</p>
    <p> Add/Drop/Withdrawal dates: You may add or drop a course without penalty
      before the course begins. (excluding non-refundable fees) After the course
      begins the refund policy applies. For example, 60% of all applicable
      student tuition and fees will be refunded if the application for refund is
      made after 10% but before more than 20% of the course’s potential hours of
      instruction have been completed. See the Student Handbook for further
      information on adding, dropping and withdrawing from classes and on the
      college’s refund policy.</p>
    <br>
    <h2><a id="mozTocId268468" class="mozTocH2"></a> Attendance and
      Participation</h2>
    <p> <b>Course attendance/participation policy</b>: Attendance is required.</p>
    <p> <b>What to do in case of instructor absence</b>: Continue working on
      assignments using Blackboard to guide you.</p>
    <p> <b>What to do in case of student absence</b>: See Blackboard.</p>
    <p> <b>Guidelines for tardiness</b>: If you are more than 10 minutes late,
      you’re considered absent.&nbsp; If you leave early without being
      dismissed, you’ll be marked absent.</p>
    <p> See the Student Handbook for further information on the
      Non-Attendance/No Show policy.</p>

    <p> </p>
    <h2><a id="mozTocId667322" class="mozTocH2"></a> Students who stop
      attending:</h2>
    <p> Class attendance is extremely important.&nbsp; If at any time you stop
      attending class, which will be considered an unofficial withdraw, your
      last date of attendance will be recorded and submitted for processing. You
      can have up to two weeks of unexcused absences; if you exceed this number,
      you will be withdrawn from the course. You will be notified by email 24 to
      48 hours before this occurs. If you are receiving financial aid, this may
      have an impact on your award. Financial Aid will notify you of such
      information by either email or mail. It is recommended that you contact
      the Financial Aid office for more information.</p>
    <p> Excused absences require proper documentation from credible
      sources.&nbsp; Excused absences include doctor’s or dentist’s
      appointments, medical conditions that prevent you from attending class, a
      death in your immediate family (siblings, parents, or grandparents), work
      or work-shift changes, and jury duty.&nbsp; In order for your absence to
      be excused, you must fill out the “Unexcused Absences” assignment in
      Blackboard and upload the required documentation.&nbsp; If you absence is
      approved, you will receive a point to negate the negative point in the
      attendance section. </p>

    <h2><a id="mozTocId676692" class="mozTocH2"></a>Grading Plan</h2>
    <p> The grading scale is a scale of points possible and / or weighting of
      points that equate to a grade and what is acceptable for successful
      completion of the class. I will make every attempt to return your
      assignments/papers/tests within 48 to 72 hours.&nbsp; This does not apply
      to assignments that are submitted late. </p>
    <h3><a id="mozTocId557617" class="mozTocH3"></a> Policies on late
      assignments and makeup tests: </h3>
    <p>You will be creating your own due date plan for turning in assignments
      and taking assessments. </p>
    <p> This does not apply to the final exam.&nbsp; </p>
    <p> All writing assignments are required.</p>
    <p> The final exam in this course is pass/fail, which means that if you
      don’t pass the final exam, you do not pass the class.&nbsp; You get two
      attempts at the final exam.&nbsp; For the second attempt, you will be
      allowed to edit your prior submission, correcting any problems that
      prevented you from receiving a passing grade.&nbsp; All attempts must be
      completed before grading day.&nbsp; You must have an 80% or better to take
      the final exam.</p>

    <h2><a id="mozTocId666676" class="mozTocH2"></a> Plagiarism and Cheating</h2>
    <p> All students must be honest and forthright in their academic studies. To
      falsify the results of one’s research, to steal the words or ideas of
      another, to cheat on an assignment, or to allow or assist another to
      commit these acts corrupts the educational process. Students are expected
      to do their own work and neither give nor receive unauthorized assistance.
      Any violation of this standard must be reported to the Judicial Affairs
      Officer and the Department Dean. The faculty member, in consultation with
      the Department Dean and the Judicial Affairs Officer, will decide whether
      the matter should be processed through the Student Conduct System or
      resolved without a formal hearing. In the latter case, the faculty member
      must have the agreement of all students directly affected.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> See BTC’s Student Code of Conduct in the student handbook for more
      information. Depending on the severity of the violation of the Student
      Code of Conduct, the result can be anything from a warning to failure of
      the assignment to being dropped from the course or program or even the
      college. </p>

    <p> Guidelines for citing copyrighted materials are available through
      various style guides.&nbsp; You should use the style guide that will be
      used in your program courses.&nbsp; Medical fields like nursing,
      radiography, and physical therapy use APA Style Guide while Criminal
      Justice, Business, and Culinary Arts use MLA.</p>
    &nbsp;<br>
    Written assignments submitted through Blackboard are analyzed by SafeAssign
    software for plagiarism.&nbsp; If any problems exist, you will be provided
    with the opportunity to fix them and resubmit them for a better grade unless
